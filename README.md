# Customer-Analysis-Dashboard
The Customer Analysis Dashboard on Tableau provides valuable insights into key aspects of business performance. It includes a line plot showcasing the revenue per month, allowing users to analyze the revenue trends over time. Another line plot presents the correlation between quantity and discount, helping identify any potential relationship between these variables. Additionally, a correlation diagram visually represents the correlation between quantity and discount. To gain geographical insights, the dashboard includes a revenue map that highlights revenue distribution across different states. Furthermore, a drop-down menu enables users to select specific categories for analysis, while a text field conveniently displays the total revenue. This comprehensive dashboard empowers users to explore customer-related metrics and make data-driven decisions to enhance business strategies.
